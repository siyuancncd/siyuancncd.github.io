## About Me

I'm Siyuan Duan, currently a master's student at the College of Computer Science, [Sichuan University (SCU)](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/) <img src="assets/img/scu-logo.png" alt="SCU Logo" width="22" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 5px;">, fortunately advised by Prof. [Dezhong Peng](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1282/13563.htm) & Prof. [Peng Hu](https://penghu-cs.github.io). 

I am also an incoming Ph.D candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) <img src="assets/img/hkust-logo-white.png" alt="HKUST Logo" width="80" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;">. I will conduct my doctoral studies at the department’s [Smart Lab](https://smartlab.cse.ust.hk/) under the supervision of Prof. [Hao Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~jhc/).

## Research Interests

- **Multi-modal Learning:** Including cross-modal retrieval and multi-view classification.
- **AI for Science:** Utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving PDE problems.
