## About Me

I'm Siyuan Duan, currently a master's student at the [College of Computer Science, Sichuan University](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), fortunately advised by Prof. [Dezhong Peng](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1282/13563.htm) & Prof. [Peng Hu](https://penghu-cs.github.io). 

I am about to pursue my doctoral degree at the [Smart Lab](https://smartlab.cse.ust.hk/), under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering ([CSE](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/)) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/)). It is my honor to be advised by Prof. [Hao Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~jhc/) during my doctoral studies.

## Research Interests

- **Multi-modal Learning:** Including cross-modal retrieval and multi-view classification.
- **AI for Science:** Utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving PDE problems.

🌟 **If you are interested in collaborating with me or want to have a chat, please feel free to contact me via email**.
